                              We are a Team of six students of the mayor International Media and Computing (BoS). In the summersemester 2020 we occupied
                              the project "B2 - Unity Game im Bereich mit der Oculus Quest" coordinated by Prof. Dr.-Ing. David Strippgen. We ourselves
                              call it the project "VR for Future". We think that the technology of virtual and augmented reality will be of great importance
                              in a digital future. Therefore we are ambitious about learning. Therefore we received three Oculus Quests that we share with each other.

                              For our project we decided to create a game in a low-poly style. We are discovering many new features with the Oculus Integreation
                              and features that are connected to the mayor mechanics: climbind and hunting. We are already convinced that our game is fun to play.
